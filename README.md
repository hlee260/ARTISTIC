# ARTISTIC
ARTISTIC was run with python 3.12.7. All processes are using the following packages (please download one-by-one if necessary):

import re

import os

import pandas as pd

import RNA

# Running the code

ARTISTIC contains the functions for generating dART sequences and extracting buffer conditions for titration experiment.

Main is used to input the target ligand. ARTISTIC find aptamers from UTexas_Datasheet [Askari, A., et al., Nuc. Acid Res. 52, 351â€“359 (2024)], extract the aptamer name, sequence, buffer conditions, and reported Kd. We demonstrate building dARTs for thrombin here as an example.

ARTISTIC will produce an excel file containing the dART sequences to order, and prescribe experiments for titrating different salts and ligand concentrations.
